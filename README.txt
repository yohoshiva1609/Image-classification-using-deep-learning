Hello this is YOHOSHIVA
let us do some image classification using deep learning technique CNN (convolutional neural network) Download the data set in the repository along with the code.
How CNN is work?
1.Convolution 
2.Max pooling
3.Flattening
4.Full Connection

1.Convolution:
it is a technique to find the features in the given image in convolution we have input_image and feature Detector. after convolution, we got a feature map as output. The feature Detector is a layer applied to the input image.

2.Max Pooling:
we have different types of poolings like mean pooling, max pooling,ect.what is max pooling means it was a 2*2 matrix applied on Feature map after max-pooling we got pooled feature map.

3.Flattening:
In flattening we convert pooled feature map to a single vector for example we have a 3*3 pooled feature map matrix we convert it into a single vector.

4.Full Connection:
After converting the pooled feature map into a single vector we connected every vector through neurons.
